## JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for building interactive web pages.

## Key Features

- Dynamic typing
- Prototype-based inheritance
- First-class functions
- Single-threaded event-driven model

## Event Delegation

Event delegation refers to the practice of using a single event listener to manage all similar events within a parent element rather than assigning individual listeners to each child element.

## let, const, and var

- `let` and `const` are block-scoped.
- `var` is function-scoped.
- `const` is used for constant values.
- `let` allows variable reassignment.

## Closures

A closure is a function that has access to variables from its outer (enclosing) scope, even after the outer function has finished execution.

## this Keyword

`this` refers to the context in which a function is executed. Its value is determined by how the function is called.

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous Programming

In synchronous programming, operations are performed one at a time in a sequence. In asynchronous programming, operations can be started, and the program can continue while waiting for those operations to complete.

## Promises

Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations. They represent a value that might be available now, or in the future, or never.

## let Keyword in ES6

The `let` keyword declares block-scoped variables. Variables declared with `let` are not hoisted to the top of the block.

## Event Loop

The event loop is a core concept in JavaScript that allows the asynchronous, non-blocking execution of code. It manages the execution of callbacks and events.

## Callback Functions

Callback functions are functions passed as arguments to other functions. They are commonly used in asynchronous programming to handle tasks after a specific operation has completed.

## bind Method

The `bind` method is used to create a new function with a specified `this` value and an initial set of arguments.
