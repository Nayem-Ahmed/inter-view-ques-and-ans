## Introduction

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for building web applications. Understanding JavaScript concepts and being able to answer related interview questions is essential for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Questions

### Data Types and Variables

1. **What are the primitive data types in JavaScript?**
   - Answer: The primitive data types in JavaScript are string, number, boolean, undefined, null, and symbol (added in ES6).
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let name = "John";
     let age = 30;
     let isAdult = true;
     let x; // undefined
     let y = null;
     ```

2. **What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`?**
   - Answer: 
     - `let` and `const` are block-scoped, while `var` is function-scoped.
     - `const` is used for constant values and cannot be reassigned.
     - `let` allows variable reassignment.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const PI = 3.14;
     let radius = 5;
     radius = 10; // Allowed with let, not with const
     var count = 0; // Function-scoped
     ```

### Functions

3. **What is a callback function?**
   - Answer: A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked inside the outer function.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     function greet(name) {
         console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
     }

     function processUserInput(callback) {
         let name = prompt("Please enter your name:");
         callback(name);
     }

     processUserInput(greet);
     ```

4. **What are arrow functions?**
   - Answer: Arrow functions are a concise way to write function expressions in JavaScript. They have a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const add = (a, b) => a + b;
     const square = x => x * x;
     ```

### Objects

5. **What is an object in JavaScript?**
   - Answer: An object is a collection of key-value pairs where keys are strings (or symbols) and values can be of any data type, including other objects or functions.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let person = {
         name: "John",
         age: 30,
         greet: function() {
             console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
         }
     };

     person.greet();
     ```

6. **What is the difference between dot notation and bracket notation when accessing object properties?**
   - Answer: Dot notation is used when the property name is known at development time, while bracket notation is used when the property name is dynamically determined or when it contains special characters.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let person = { name: "John" };
     console.log(person.name); // Dot notation
     console.log(person['name']); // Bracket notation
     ```

### Arrays

7. **How do you create an array in JavaScript?**
   - Answer: You can create an array by enclosing comma-separated values within square brackets `[]`.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     ```

8. **What is the difference between `push()` and `pop()` methods in JavaScript arrays?**
   - Answer: 
     - The `push()` method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
     - The `pop()` method removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
     fruits.push("orange"); // ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
     fruits.pop(); // "orange", ["apple", "banana"]
     ```

### Control Flow

9. **What is the difference between `==` and `===` operators in JavaScript?**
    - Answer:
      - `==` compares two values after converting them to a common type.
      - `===` (strict equality) compares two values without type conversion. It returns true only if both the value and the type are the same.
    - Example:
      ```javascript
      console.log(5 == "5"); // true
      console.log(5 === "5"); // false
      ```

10. **Explain the difference between `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.**
    - Answer: 
      - `if` statement is used for conditional execution when a single condition is true.
      - `else if` statement is used for additional conditions after the initial `if` condition.
      - `else` statement is used for executing code when none of the preceding conditions are true.
    - Example:
      ```javascript
      let num = 5;
      if (num > 0) {
          console.log("Positive");
      } else if (num < 0) {
          console.log("Negative");
      } else {
          console.log("Zero");
      }
      ```

### Async Programming

11. **What is a Promise in JavaScript?**
    - Answer: A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It allows handling asynchronous operations more elegantly than callbacks.
    - Example:
      ```javascript
      function fetchData() {
          return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
              // Asynchronous operation
              setTimeout(() => {
                  resolve("Data fetched successfully");
              }, 2000);
          });
      }

      fetchData().then(data => {
          console.log(data);
      });
      ```

12. **What is `async` and `await` in JavaScript?**
    - Answer: `async` and `await` are keywords used to handle Promises more cleanly and synchronously. The `async` keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, while the `await` keyword is used to pause execution until a Promise is fulfilled.
    - Example:
      ```javascript
      async function fetchData() {
          let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
          let data = await response.json();
          return data;
      }

      fetchData().then(data => {
          console.log(data);
      });
      ```

### DOM Manipulation

13. **How do you select elements in the DOM using JavaScript?**
    - Answer: You can select elements using methods like `getElementById()`, `getElementsByClassName()`, `getElementsByTagName()`, `querySelector()`, and `querySelectorAll()`.
    - Example:
      ```javascript
      let elementById = document.getElementById('myElement');
      let elementsByClassName = document.getElementsByClassName('myClass');
      let elementsByTagName = document.getElementsByTagName('div');
      let elementByQuerySelector = document.querySelector('.myClass');
      let elementsByQuerySelectorAll = document.querySelectorAll('.myClass');
      ```

14. **How do you add an event listener to an element in JavaScript?**
    - Answer: You can add an event listener using the `addEventListener()` method, specifying the event type and a callback function to execute when the event occurs.
    - Example:
      ```javascript
      document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
          console.log('Button clicked');
      });
      ```

### Error Handling

15. **What is error handling in JavaScript?**
    - Answer: Error handling is the process of managing errors that may occur during the execution of a program. JavaScript provides constructs like `try...catch` and `throw` for error handling.
    - Example:
      ```javascript
      try {
          // Code that may throw an error
          throw new Error('Something went wrong');
      } catch (error) {
          console.error(error);
      }
      ```

16. **What is the purpose of the `throw` statement in JavaScript?**
    - Answer: The `throw` statement is used to throw a custom error or exception. It interrupts the execution of a script and can be caught by surrounding code with a `try...catch` block.
    - Example:
      ```javascript
      function divide(x, y) {
          if (y === 0) {
              throw new Error('Divide by zero error');
          }
          return x / y;
      }

      try {
          console.log(divide(10, 0));
      } catch (error) {
          console.error(error);
      }
      ```

### ES6+ Features

17. **What are template literals in ES6?**
    - Answer: Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions. They are enclosed by backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes and can contain placeholders `${...}` for variable interpolation.
    - Example:
      ```javascript
      let name = 'John';
      console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
      ```

18. **What is the spread syntax (`...`) in ES6?**
    - Answer: The spread syntax (`...`) allows an iterable (like an array or string) to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments or elements are expected.
    - Example:
      ```javascript
      let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
      let newArray = [...numbers, 4, 5];
      console.log(newArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      ```
